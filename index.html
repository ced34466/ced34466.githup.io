        <h2>Prada's History</h2>
      
        
        <p>
            Prada is a <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">luxurious</span>fashion house that was founded in 1913 by Mario Prada in Milian, Italy. They specialize in leather handbags, shoes, perfumes, and other fashion pieces and accessories. The company first started as a small leather shop that sold animal goods  and English trunks and handbags. The shop was originally known as Fratelli Prada. 
        <p>
        Mario Prada strongly believed that women did not belong in the work force and therefore prevented the females within his family to work for his company. Ironically, upon his death, his daughter, Luisa Prada, took over the business and successfully ran it for nearly twenty years. Eventually her daughter, Miuccia Prada, joined the company in 1970 and took over in 1978. 
      
    
        <p>
            Through Miuccia's leadership, the company's products changed from imported English goods to the existing luggage found in Prada stores today. One of her most influential developments was the creation of the water proof backpacks that were made out of Pocone. Today, Prada has a very reputable reputation and Prada boutiques can be found around the world.
